Project overviw :- 

The goal of a weather dashboard is to provide users with real-time weather data and forecasts for a specific location using a weather API like OpenWeatherMap. This project involves integrating API data with a clean and user-friendly interface, allowing users to get relevant weather information easily.

Key Features:
Location Input:

The user enters a city name or allows the app to detect their location using geolocation.
The app fetches weather data for the entered or detected location.
Current Weather Display:

Display of real-time weather information for the location, including:
Temperature
Weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy)
Humidity
Wind speed
Weather icon (e.g., sun, cloud, rain) provided by the API.
Weather Forecast:

The app can display a multi-day weather forecast (e.g., next 5 days), showing:
Forecasted temperature
Predicted weather conditions
Weather icons for each day.
Weather Icons:

The weather API provides icons that visually represent the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy). These icons will be used to improve the dashboard’s user interface.
API Integration:
API Choice:

Use a reliable API, such as OpenWeatherMap, which offers current weather data, weather forecasts, and icons via an easy-to-use API.
Example of an API endpoint for fetching current weather data:
bash
Copy code
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city_name}&appid={API_key}
Fetching Data:

Use JavaScript's fetch() function to make an API request when the user enters a location or clicks a button.
Example code to fetch data:
javascript
Copy code
fetch('https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));
Parsing API Response:

The response from the API contains weather data in JSON format. This data includes:
Current temperature
Weather conditions (e.g., "clear sky")
Wind speed
Humidity level
An icon code (e.g., "icon": "01d") to display the weather condition.
Error Handling:

The app should handle errors gracefully, such as:
Invalid city names
Issues connecting to the API
API rate limits.
User Interface (UI) Design:
Input Section:

A text box or input field for entering the city name.
Optionally, a "use my location" button to auto-detect the user's location using the browser's Geolocation API.
Weather Display Section:

A section showing the current weather information.
Icons corresponding to weather conditions (e.g., sun, clouds).
Temperature (current, feels like).
Humidity and wind speed.
Forecast Section:

A series of cards or rows showing the weather forecast for the upcoming days.
Each day’s forecast will display a small weather icon, predicted temperature, and weather description.
Frontend Logic:
Data Rendering:

Once the weather data is fetched, it needs to be dynamically inserted into the DOM (HTML elements). For example, updating text fields for the temperature, inserting weather icons, etc.

The UI should refresh automatically when the user inputs a new location.
Styling:

Use CSS to style the dashboard and ensure a responsive layout.
Weather icons should be visually prominent to make the app more engaging.
Responsiveness:

The dashboard should be responsive, ensuring that it works on both mobile devices and desktops.
